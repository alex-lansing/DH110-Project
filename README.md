# Digital Application for Learning Music
### Alexandra Lansing

## Intro & Design Statement
This project aims to improve the experience of learning music through digital applications. Mobile apps and websites have become increasingly popular platforms for education. With numerous digital resources, learning a new skill seems as easy as the click of a button. In regards to learning music, YouTube provides instrument tutorials, Abelton.com offers digital music lessons, Musicate provides lessons on mobile devicesâ€¦ countless platforms present learning material for musicians.

But despite the many resources, there is still a limited amount of mobile applications that support music learners' needs. Users of all levels should be able to access material that is tailored to their interests and expertise. Based on my observations from usability testing and user research, music learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level. Furthermore, music cannot exist without a community. My qualitative research has shown that one of the most valued aspects of music creation is creating with other people. Musicians require insight, support, and collaboration. Yet many of them struggle to find partners. Even with current social media, it is difficult for musicians to find others that are 1) nearby and 2) looking to practice together.

These findings thus inspired TuneMate: a mobile application that provides personalized music lessons and a platform to connect local musicians. TuneMate users can access lessons tailored to their interests and experience by completing an evaluative placement quiz. They can also find musicians nearby by joining local group chats and messaging others.learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level. 

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristics Evaluation
I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the music theory learning site, [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/), and the digital music making site, [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html). I chose to analyze these sources to observe how modern websites educate users about music. Through the heuristics evaluation, I aimed to learn what adds to the usability and educative qualities of both sites, and further, identify improvements for a better user experience.

## Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
I conducted a usability test with the [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html) website. Usability testing (UT) evaluates a product by testing representative users through observation and user feedback. Conducting a UT would help identify potential issues in the Learning Music site, thus directing improvements that would result in a more effective, efficient, and satisfactory product for users.
