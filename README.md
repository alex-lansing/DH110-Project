# Digital Application for Learning Music
### Alexandra Lansing

## Introduction
This project aims to improve the experience of learning music through digital applications. Mobile apps and websites have become increasingly popular platforms for education. With numerous digital resources, learning a new skill seems as easy as the click of a button. In regards to learning music, YouTube provides instrument tutorials, Abelton.com offers digital music lessons, and Musicate provides music lessons on mobile devices.

Despite the many resources for music learning, there is still a limited amount of mobile applications that support music learners' needs. Musicians of all levels should be able to access material that is tailored to their interests and expertise. Based on my observations from usability testing and user research, music learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level.
