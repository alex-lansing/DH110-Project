# Digital Application for Learning Music
### Alexandra Lansing

## Intro & Design Statement
This project aims to improve the experience of learning music through digital applications. Mobile apps and websites have become increasingly popular platforms for education. With numerous digital resources, learning a new skill seems as easy as the click of a button. In regards to learning music, YouTube provides instrument tutorials, Abelton.com offers digital music lessons, Musicate provides lessons on mobile devicesâ€¦ countless platforms present learning material for musicians.

But despite the many resources, there is still a limited amount of mobile applications that support music learners' needs. Users of all levels should be able to access material that is tailored to their interests and expertise. Based on my observations from usability testing and user research, music learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level. Furthermore, music cannot exist without a community. My qualitative research has shown that one of the most valued aspects of music creation is creating with other people. Musicians require insight, support, and collaboration. Yet many of them struggle to find partners. Even with current social media, it is difficult for musicians to find others that are 1) nearby and 2) looking to practice together.

These findings thus inspired TuneMate: a mobile application that provides personalized music lessons and a platform to connect local musicians. TuneMate users can access lessons tailored to their interests and experience by completing an evaluative placement quiz. They can also find musicians nearby by joining local group chats and messaging others.learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level. 

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristics Evaluation
I began my research with a heuristics evaluation of the music theory learning site, [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/), and the digital music making site, [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html). I chose to analyze these sources to observe how modern websites educate users about music. Through the heuristics evaluation, I aimed to learn what adds to the usability and educative qualities of both sites, and further, identify improvements for a better user experience.

## Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
I conducted a usability test with the [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html) website. Usability testing (UT) evaluates a product by testing representative users through observation and user feedback. Conducting a UT would help identify potential issues in the Learning Music site, thus directing improvements that would result in a more effective, efficient, and satisfactory product for users.

## User Research
My qualitative user research aimed to investigate how users interact with music-making products to learn music. In this study, I hoped to further understand how a pianist learns music through digital applications and the piano instrument. This study would provide insight for improvements needed in the design of online music-learning platforms.

## UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows creators and designers to consider the perspectives of different users. Storytelling highlights the context behind why and how a user interacts with a product. This is important for designing an interface and for usability testing because it can bring forward potential issues of a product, and inspires improvements that appeal to a broader span of users. I focused my scenarios on 2 main tasks: 1) identify where to begin in a music lesson and 2) find and connect with other local musicians/music learners.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype & User Testing
With research and user scenarios complete, I developed a low-fidelity prototype that integrates the features of my product idea. The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test the functionality and flow of features utilized in envisioned tasks. The tasks supported by this prototype are as follows:

1. Complete the Placement Quiz to find out which Lesson to start on
2. Navigate to different Lessons
3. Check lesson progress
4. Find other musicians through a Group Chat
5. Create a Post in the Group Chat
6. Comment on another user's post
7. Direct Message another user

I created the wireframes and wireflow of a low-fidelity prototype for a mobile music-learning application. I then conducted wireflow testing for further insight. My wireframes and usage scenarios are displayed below. Read more to view the full wireflow and wireflow testing.

## Interface Design
The purpose of UX Interface Design is to convert low-fidelity wireframes into digitized designs that will later be transformed into interactive prototypes and a final application. My design process was created through Figma. I utilized the iPhone 13 / 13 Pro screen size to frame my overall app design. During my process, I tested different typography, shape, and color variations for the app's main "Lessons" page. After completion of the design, I ran two impression tests to further assist my process. An accessibility test was also ran to check for proper color contrast.

## High-Fidelity Prototype
To bring my idea to life, I created a working prototype of my product, TuneMate. My prototype aims to present a thorough demonstration of the graphic design and interactivity of the mobile application. I used Figma to create my prototype while following my prior-created wireframes and wireflow.
